Tour of Heroes

This is my first angular project, I just did what I was asked to do in the documentation.

You can check the angular website to get started. Follow this link https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/. I decided to use typescript but you can use javascript if you want.

All you have to do is type these in your terminal/ command prompt/ command line

1. npm install
2. npm start

With these, you are good to go to an extent. In the sense that, I would change what I want this app to look like later but for now, this is all I want to use.

I added a folder that hides all your .js and .map.js files whenever there is a .ts file in that same folder. You can also make them save in another folder entirely.
