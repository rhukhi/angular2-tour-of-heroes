This is my first angular project, I just did what I was asked to do in the documentation.

You can check the angular website to get started. Follow this link https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. I decided to use typescript but you can use javascript if you want.

Whenever you want to use this code,go to your terminal and all you have to do is direct it to the directory where what you have cloned is and type "npm install". This is to install all the dependencies and dev dependencies.

After that, you then have to type "npm start". This is to make the app start. It might take a long time but patience is very key.
